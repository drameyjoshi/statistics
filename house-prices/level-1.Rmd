## MSSubClass and MSZoning
A contingency table of these variables.
```{r}
with(training.data,
     table(MSSubClass, MSZoning))
```

Even in the heavilty populated 'RL' and 'RM' classes, the data is not evenly 
distributed across MSSubClass. Therefore, the two are not correlated.

Is there a scope to reduce levels?
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ MSZoning, training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

Levels RM and RL seem close. Let us investigate.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ MSZoning, training.data, subset = MSZoning %in% c("RM", "RH"))
```

They can be clubbed together.
```{r}
msz.map <- data.frame(MSZoning = X[order(X$avg.price), "MSZoning"],
                      MSZoning.class = as.factor(c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4)))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, msz.map)[, c("MSZoning.class", "SalePrice")]
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ MSZoning.class, X)
bwplot(SalePrice ~ MSZoning.class, X)
rm(X, msz.map)
```

MSZoning, after reduction of levels seems to resolve sale price well.

We repeat the exercise for MSSubClass.
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ MSSubClass, training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

There seems to be a scope for clubbing levels together.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ MSSubClass,
            data = training.data,
            subset = MSSubClass %in% c(30, 180, 45))
```

They can be combined into a single level.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ MSSubClass,
            data = training.data,
            subset = MSSubClass %in% c(190, 90, 160))
```

These three too can get together.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ MSSubClass,
            data = training.data,
            subset = MSSubClass %in% c(50, 85, 40))
```

We can combine them.

```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ MSSubClass,
            data = training.data,
            subset = MSSubClass %in% c(70, 80))
```

We can combine them.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ MSSubClass,
            data = training.data,
            subset = MSSubClass %in% c(20, 75, 120))
```

We can club these together. Thus, we can map the old levels to
```{r}
mss.map <-
  data.frame(MSSubClass = X[order(X$avg.price), "MSSubClass"],
             MSSubClass.class = as.factor(
               c(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 3), rep(3, 3), rep(4, 2), rep(5, 3), 6)
             ))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, mss.map)[, c("SalePrice", "MSSubClass.class")]
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ MSSubClass.class, X)
bwplot(SalePrice ~ MSSubClass.class, X)
rm(X, mss.map)
```

## Lot shape and configuration
```{r}
with(training.data, table(LotShape, LotConfig))
```

These variables too do not seem to be correlated. How does mean sale price vary
across them?
```{r}
aggregate(SalePrice ~ LotShape, data = training.data, mean)
aggregate(SalePrice ~ LotConfig, data = training.data, mean)
```

The average sale price for LotConfig values 'Corner', 'FR2' and 'Inside' are quite close to
each other. Let us check if they can be considered to be unequal.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ LotConfig,
            data = training.data,
            subset = LotConfig %in% c("Corner","FR2", "Inside"))
```

The $p$-value indicates that they should be clubbed together in a level 'CF2I'.
```{r}
X <- training.data[, c("LotConfig", "LotShape", "SalePrice")]
# We need as.character because LotConfig is a factor, not a string.
X$LotConfig.1 <- ifelse(X$LotConfig %in% c("Corner","FR2", "Inside"), 
                        "CF2I", 
                        as.character(X$LotConfig))
with(X, table(LotShape, LotConfig.1))
```

Even after collapsing three LotConfig levels into one, there is not corelation
between the two variables. We, therefore, retain both, the second one after
combining levels. Let us look at the distribution of sale price across their 
levels.
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ LotConfig.1, X)
```

```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ LotShape, X)
```

LotConfig, after collapsing to three levels seems to be better at resolving
sale price than lot shape. We, therefore, retain the latter.

## Land contour
Average sale price varies by land contour as
```{r}
aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ LandContour, 
          data = training.data, 
          mean)
```

The division seems quite sharp and so far I haven't discovered another variable
that could be related to it. We will retain it after examining the distribution
of sale prices.
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ LandContour, training.data)
```

I think we should retain this variable.

## Neighborhood
Average sale price varies with neighborhood as
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ Neighborhood,
          data = training.data,
          mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

Although the group means are different, there is scope to collapse the 
neighborhoods into fewer number of classes.
```{r}
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Neighborhood,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Neighborhood %in% c("MeadowV", "IDOTRR", "BrDale")
)
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Neighborhood,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Neighborhood %in% c("BrkSide", "Edwards", "OldTown")
)
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Neighborhood,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Neighborhood %in% c("SWISU", "Blueste", "Sawyer", "NPkVill", "NAmes", "Mitchel")
)
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Neighborhood,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Neighborhood %in% c("CollgCr", "Blmngtn", "Gilbert", "NWAmes", "SawyerW")
)
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Neighborhood,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Neighborhood %in% c("Somerst", "ClearCr", "Crawfor", "Veenker", "Timber")
)
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Neighborhood,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Neighborhood %in% c("StoneBr", "NridgHt", "NoRidge")
)
```

Thus, we will classify neighborhoods as
```{r}
nbd.map <-
  data.frame(Neighborhood = X[order(X$avg.price), "Neighborhood"],
             nbd.class = c(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 3), rep(3, 6), rep(4, 5), rep(5, 5), rep(6, 3)))
nbd.map$nbd.class <- as.factor(nbd.map$nbd.class)
rm(X)
```

We will now use the new neighborhood classes and find out if sale price 
continues to be well resolved.
```{r}
X <- merge(training.data, nbd.map)[, c("nbd.class", "SalePrice")]
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ nbd.class, data = X)
```

The average sale prices are
```{r}
aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ nbd.class, data = X, mean)
```

We confirm that the neighborhood classes 2 and 3 are indeed different.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ nbd.class, data = X, subset = nbd.class %in% c(2, 3))
```

Before closing, we check the box plot of sale prices with new classes.
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ nbd.class, X)
rm(X, nbd.map)
```

We retain Neighborhood after collapsing $25$ levels into $6$.

## Condition1
We sort the levels by average sale price.
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ Condition1,
               training.data,
               mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

We explore if we can have three levels instead of nine.
```{r}
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Condition1,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Condition1 %in% c("Artery", "RRAe", "Feedr")
)
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Condition1,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Condition1 %in% c("RRNe", "Norm", "RRAn")
)
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ Condition1,
  data = training.data,
  subset = Condition1 %in% c("RRNn", "PosN", "PosA")
)
```

We will now confirm that this grouping of levels of Condition1 resolves sale 
price.
```{r}
cond1.map = data.frame(Condition1 = X[order(X$avg.price), "Condition1"],
                      cond1.class = c(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 3), rep(3, 3)))
cond1.map$cond1.class <- as.factor(cond1.map$cond1.class)
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, cond1.map)[, c("cond1.class", "SalePrice")]
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ cond1.class, X)
```

A distribution of sale prices across the new classes is
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ cond1.class, X)
rm(X, cond1.map)
```

Level 1 has a significant overlap with level 2. I think it is entirely contained
in level 2. We should, therefore, drop this variable.

## BldgType
We can possibly have only two types of buildings.
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ BldgType, training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

We will use the following mapping.
```{r}
bldgtype.map <- data.frame(BldgType = X[order(X$avg.price), "BldgType"],
                           BldgType.class = c(rep(1, 3), rep(2, 2)))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, bldgtype.map)[, c("BldgType.class", "SalePrice")]
aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ BldgType.class, X, mean)
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ BldgType.class, X)
```

Let us see a distribution of prices across the new classes.
```{r}
bwplot(BldgType.class ~ SalePrice, X)
```

```{r}
rm(X, bldgtype.map)
```

Level 1 is entirely contained in level 2. We therefore drop this variable.

## HouseStyle
We can reduce the levels in HouseStyle as well.
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ HouseStyle, training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

Choosing the right group of variables will need a closer examination.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ HouseStyle,
            data = training.data,
            subset = HouseStyle %in% c("1.5Unf", "SFoyer"))
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ HouseStyle,
  data = training.data,
  subset = HouseStyle %in% c("1.5Unf", "SFoyer", "1.5Fin")
)
```

These are not the right groupings.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ HouseStyle,
            data = training.data,
            subset = HouseStyle %in% c("SFoyer", "1.5Fin"))
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ HouseStyle,
  data = training.data,
  subset = HouseStyle %in% c("SFoyer", "1.5Fin", "2.5Unf")
)
oneway.test(
  SalePrice ~ HouseStyle,
  data = training.data,
  subset = HouseStyle %in% c("SFoyer", "1.5Fin", "2.5Unf", "SLvl")
)
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ HouseStyle,
            data = training.data,
            subset = HouseStyle %in% c("2.5Unf", "SLvl"))
```

The groups so far are, {"1.5Unf"}, {"SFoyer", "1.5Fn"}, {"2.5Unf", "SLvl"}.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ HouseStyle, data = training.data, subset = HouseStyle %in% c("2.5Unf", "SLvl"))
```

I am not seeing a satisfactory grouping evolve. A distribution of prices across
building types is
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ HouseStyle, data = training.data)
```

A wide overlap of prices across house styles and a large number of outliers
suggests that HouseStyle is probably not a good predictor of sale price.

## Overall condition and quality
We first check if there is a correlation between the two.
```{r}
with(training.data, table(OverallCond, OverallQual))
```

This does not give much insight. It would be nice to see the mean instead.
```{r}
X <- with(training.data, tapply(SalePrice, list(OverallCond, OverallQual), mean))
```

Row wise range of average sale price is
```{r}
Xr <- apply(X, 1, function(x) range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
Xr[2, ] - Xr[1, ]
```

Column wise range of average sale price is
```{r}
Xc <- apply(X, 2, function(x) range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
Xc[2, ] - Xc[1, ]
```

Column-wise range is narrower than row-wise range. Therefore, we will use overall
quality instead of overall condition in our analysis.

How do the group means look like?
```{r}
rm(X, Xc, Xr)
X <-
  aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ OverallQual, 
            training.data, mean)[, c("OverallQual", "avg.price")]
X[order(X$avg.price),]
```

Let us check if the classes 1 and 2 could be combined?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ OverallQual, 
            data = training.data, 
            subset = OverallQual %in% c(1, 2))
```

There is a strong evidence that they are the same. Although this looks like a 
great predictor, we will still review a distribution of sale price across its 
levels after combining levels 1 and 2.
```{r}
overall.qual.map <- 
  data.frame(OverallQual = X[order(X$avg.price), "OverallQual"],
             overall.qual.class = c(2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 ,9 ,10))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, overall.qual.map)[, c("overall.qual.class", "SalePrice")]
X$overall.qual.class <- as.factor(X$overall.qual.class)
bwplot(SalePrice ~ overall.qual.class, X)
rm(X, overall.qual.map)
```

This looks quite good.

## Roof style
A distribution of average sale price is
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ RoofStyle,
          data = training.data,
          mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

Are 'Gable' and 'Mansard' similar?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ RoofStyle,
            data = training.data,
            subset = RoofStyle %in% c("Gable", "Mansard"))
```

They are. Let us combine them.
```{r}
roofstyle.map <- data.frame(
  RoofStyle = X[order(X$avg.price), "RoofStyle"],
  RoofStyle.class = as.factor(c(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5))
)
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, roofstyle.map)[, c("RoofStyle.class", "SalePrice")]
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ RoofStyle.class, data = X)
bwplot(SalePrice ~ RoofStyle.class, X)
rm(X, roofstyle.map)
```

Although there the means are all different, there is a significant overlap 
between the categories. For instance, all of '1' lies within the limits of '2'.
The class '3' overlaps entirely with classes '2' and '4'. The class '5' overlaps
with '2', '3' and '4'. Perhaps, RoofStyle is not going to be useful in our first
model.

## External quality and condition
We will follow the procedure we used to examine overall quality and condition.
First, a contingency table of the two variables is
```{r}
with(training.data,
     table(ExterQual, ExterCond))
```

Given that 'TA' stands for 'typical/average', 'Gd' for good and 'Fa' for fair
there is a good chance the three terms are used interchangeably. We will explore
if we can club them together. But before we do that, we want to see which one of
these variables resolves sale price better than the other.
```{r}
X <- with(training.data, 
          tapply(SalePrice, list(ExterQual,ExterCond), mean))
X
```

The row-wise and column-wise ranges are
```{r}
Xr <- apply(X, 1, function(x) range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
Xc <- apply(X, 2, function(x) range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
print("Row wise ranges are:")
Xr[2, ] - Xr[1, ]
print("Column wise ranges are:")
Xc[2, ] - Xc[1, ]
```

Column wise ranges are narrower. Therefore, we choose External Quality instead
of External Condition. The group means are
```{r}
aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ ExterQual, training.data, mean)
```

They are sufficiently far apart from each other. Nevertheless, we also look at
the box plots.
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ ExterQual, training.data)
rm(X, Xc, Xr)
```

How is external quality correlated with overall quality?
```{r}
with(training.data,
     table(ExterQual, OverallQual))
```

A contingency table of the means is
```{r}
X <- with(training.data,
          tapply(SalePrice, list(ExterQual, OverallQual), mean))
X
```

The row-wise and column-wise ranges are
```{r}
Xr <- apply(X, 1, function(x) range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
Xc <- apply(X, 2, function(x) range(x, na.rm = TRUE))
paste("Row-wise range is:")
Xr[2, ] - Xr[1, ]
paste("Column-wise range is:")
Xc[2, ] - Xc[1, ]
rm(X, Xc, Xr)
```

Among the two, we will retain OverallQual.

## Foundation
The group means are
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ Foundation, training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

We will check if six levels can be collapsed into four.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Foundation,
            data = training.data,
            subset = Foundation %in% c("BrkTil", "CBlock"))
```

These two levels cannot be combined together.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Foundation,
            data = training.data,
            subset = Foundation %in% c("Stone", "CBlock"))
```

We can combine them together. Can we add 'Wood' to the group?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Foundation,
            data = training.data,
            subset = Foundation %in% c("Stone", "CBlock", "Wood"))
```
We can. Thus, we can create the map
```{r}
foundation.map <-
  data.frame(Foundation = X[order(X$avg.price), "Foundation"],
             Foundation.class = as.factor(c(1, 2, rep(3, 3), 4)))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, foundation.map)[, c("Foundation.class", "SalePrice")]
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Foundation.class, X)
bwplot(SalePrice ~ Foundation.class, X)
rm(X, foundation.map)
```

We will retain this variable.

## Basement quality, condition, exposure and surface area
Te first three are categorical. We consider them separately. The unique levels 
of these variables are
```{r}
unique(training.data$BsmtCond)
unique(training.data$BsmtExposure)
unique(training.data$BsmtQual)
```

Some houses lack basement. How many?
```{r}
nrow(training.data[is.na(training.data$BsmtCond), ])
nrow(training.data[is.na(training.data$BsmtExposure), ])
nrow(training.data[is.na(training.data$BsmtQual), ])
```

The aggregate sale prices are
```{r}
X.c <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ BsmtCond, training.data, mean)
X.e <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ BsmtExposure, training.data, mean)
X.q <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ BsmtQual, training.data, mean)

X.c[order(X.c$avg.price), ]
X.e[order(X.e$avg.price), ]
X.q[order(X.q$avg.price), ]
rm(X.c, X.e, X.q)
```

All resolve sale price equally well. Are they correlated?
```{r}
with(training.data, table(BsmtCond, BsmtQual))
with(training.data, table(BsmtCond, BsmtExposure))
with(training.data, table(BsmtExposure, BsmtQual))
```

Basement condition and quality are related to each other. Basement exposure is
fundamentally a different variable. Let us now find out if we can select one of
basement condition and quality.
```{r}
X <- with(training.data,
          tapply(SalePrice, list(BsmtCond, BsmtQual), mean))
Xr <- apply(X, 1, function(r) range(r, na.rm = TRUE))
Xc <- apply(X, 2, function(c) range(c, na.rm = TRUE))
print("Row ranges are:")
Xr[2, ] - Xr[1, ]
print("Column ranges are:")
Xc[2, ] - Xc[1, ]
rm(X, Xr, Xc)
```

The column ranges are narrower and hence we chose BsmtQual. Is basement quality
related to overall quality?
```{r}
with(training.data, table(OverallQual, BsmtQual))
```

Excellent basements are mostly in best houses, good basements belong to those of
better than average overall quality and typical/average basements are in middle
quality houses. Thus the correlation between the two seems to be fairly strong. 
Therefore, we choose overall quality over basement quality.
A scatter plot of basement area with sale price is
```{r}
xyplot(SalePrice ~ TotalBsmtSF, data = training.data[-which(training.data$TotalBsmtSF == 0)])
```

Let us remove the cases where the basement area is zero.
```{r}
X <- training.data[training.data$TotalBsmtSF != 0, c("TotalBsmtSF", "SalePrice")]
xyplot(SalePrice ~ TotalBsmtSF, X)
```

There is a strong correlation between the two, at least visually. The correlation
coefficient is
```{r}
paste("cor = ", round(with(X, cor(SalePrice, TotalBsmtSF)), 4))
rm(X)
```

We will retain this variable. However, we must remove the zeros to get a good 
fit.

## Heating quality
How is heating quality correlated with overall quality?
```{r}
with(training.data,
     table(OverallQual, HeatingQC))
```

The good and typical/average heating quality seem to have similar behavior. Can
they be combined?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ HeatingQC,
            data = training.data,
            subset = HeatingQC %in% c("Fa", "Gd"))
```

How about good and TA? Or Fa and TA
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ HeatingQC,
            data = training.data,
            subset = HeatingQC %in% c("TA", "Gd"))
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ HeatingQC,
            data = training.data,
            subset = HeatingQC %in% c("TA", "Fa"))
```

The sale prices in all cases are statistically different. Let's see a 
contingency table with mean sale price.
```{r}
X <- with(training.data,
          tapply(SalePrice, list(OverallQual, HeatingQC), mean))
```

The two variables may be individually useful to predict sale price. A 
distribution of sale prices across heating quality is
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ HeatingQC, training.data)
```

We will retain Heating quality.

## Central air conditioning
This is a binary variable. How are sale prices distributed across it?
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ CentralAir, training.data)
```

It is quite clear that houses with central airconditioning fetch a higher price.

## Electrical
The average sale price across the level is
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ Electrical, training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

How similar are fuses P and F?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Electrical,
            data = training.data,
            subset = Electrical %in% c("FuseP", "FuseF"))
```

They can be clubbed together. Can we also include fuse A?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Electrical,
            data = training.data,
            subset = Electrical %in% c("FuseP", "FuseF", "FuseA"))
```

Thus, we can map the existing levels to Mix, Fuse and SBrkr.
```{r}
elec.map <- 
  data.frame(Electrical = X[order(X$avg.price), "Electrical"],
             Elec.class = as.factor(c(1, rep(2, 3), 3)))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, elec.map)[, c("Elec.class", "SalePrice")]
aggregate(SalePrice ~ Elec.class, X, mean)
aggregate(SalePrice ~ Elec.class, X, length)
```

There is only one case with level '1'. Therefore our oneway test should be
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Elec.class,
            data = X,
            subset = Elec.class != 1)
```

Before leaving this variable, we check the distribution of sale price across
levels.
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ Elec.class, X)
rm(X, elec.map)
```

We will retain this variable after combining all fuse types to a single category.

## GrLivArea - above grade living area
This is a numerical variable. Its summary is
```{r}
summary(training.data$GrLivArea)
```

A scatter plot of sale price versus GrLivArea is
```{r}
xyplot(SalePrice ~ GrLivArea, training.data)
```

The correlation coefficient is
```{r}
paste("cor = ", with(training.data, cor(GrLivArea, SalePrice)))
```

Is is correlated with the other numerical variable we have seen so far?
```{r}
xyplot(GrLivArea ~ TotalBsmtSF, training.data)
```

Even without removing the cases with zero total basement area the correlation is
```{r}
paste("cor = ", with(training.data, cor(GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF)))
```

If we remove the cases with zero total basement area,
```{r}
X <- training.data[training.data$TotalBsmtSF != 0, c("GrLivArea", "TotalBsmtSF")]
paste("cor =", with(X, cor(GrLivArea, TotalBsmtSF)))
rm(X)
```

We shall retain this variable.

## BsmtFullBath and FullBath
A contingency table of these variables with mean sale price is
```{r}
with(training.data, table(BsmtFullBath, FullBath))
```

A distribution of sale prices across their levels is
```{r}
bwplot(SalePrice ~ as.factor(BsmtFullBath), training.data, main = "BsmtFullBath")
bwplot(SalePrice ~ as.factor(FullBath), training.data, main = "FullBath")
```

Let us examine the group means of BsmtFullBath in greater details.
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ BsmtFullBath, training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

How close are levels 1 and 2?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ BsmtFullBath,
            data = training.data,
            subset = BsmtFullBath %in% c(1, 2))
```

They can be combined together.
```{r}
bsmt.map <- data.frame(
  BsmtFullBath = X[order(X$avg.price), "BsmtFullBath"],
  Bsmt.class = as.factor(c(rep(0, 2), rep(1, 2)))
)
X.b <- merge(training.data, bsmt.map)[, c("Bsmt.class", "FullBath", "SalePrice")]
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Bsmt.class, X.b)
bwplot(SalePrice ~ Bsmt.class, X.b)
```

Let us see how the new levels of BsmtFullBath compare against FullBath.
```{r}
with(X.b, table(Bsmt.class, FullBath))
rm(X, X.b, bsmt.map)
```

We will have to retain both.

## KitchenQual
How is it related to OverallQual?
```{r}
with(training.data, table(KitchenQual, OverallQual))
```

The table suggests that the two might be closely related. We will choose to keep
OverallQual.

## TotRmsAbvGrd
Let us first examine the group means.
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ TotRmsAbvGrd, training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
rm(X)
```

We will retain this variable.

## Functional
The group means are
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ Functional,
               training.data,
               mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

Can Min2, Min1, Maj1 and Mod be clubbed together?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ Functional,
            data = training.data,
            subset = Functional %in% c("Min2", "Min1", "Maj1", "Mod"))
```

Looks like they can be. We can also combine the lone "Sev" case with "Maj2". Let 
us do that.
```{r}
func.map <- 
  data.frame(Functional = X[order(X$avg.price), "Functional"],
             Func.class = as.factor(c(1, 1, rep(2, 4), 3)))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, func.map)[, c("Func.class", "SalePrice")]
bwplot(SalePrice ~ Func.class, X)
rm(X, func.map)
```

## FireplaceQu
The group means are
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ FireplaceQu,
               training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
rm(X)
```

The group means are well separated. Is FireplaceQu correlated with OverallQual?
```{r}
with(training.data,
     table(FireplaceQu, OverallQual))
```

It looks harder to guess one from another. Do all houses have a fire place?
```{r}
nrow(training.data[is.na(training.data$FireplaceQu), ])
```

Close to half the houses do not have a fireplace. Let us therefore drop it.

## GarageFinish and GarageCond
A contingency table of the two is
```{r}
with(training.data,
     table(GarageFinish, GarageCond))
```

They are definitely uncorrelated. We will therefore retain both of them. Is
GarageCond correlated to OverallQual?
```{r}
with(training.data,
     table(GarageCond, OverallQual))
```

I think we should drop GarageCond because it is heavily concentrated in a single
level TA. Which is also the reason why there are such a large number of outliers
in its boxplot. Moreover, a GarageCond of Ex, which stands for excellent, does
not fetch a great sale price.

How many houses do not have a garage?
```{r}
nrow(training.data[is.na(training.data$GarageFinish), ])
```

A few houses do not have a garage. Let us drop this variable in the first 
iteration of the model.

## Sale type and condition
The group means of sale type are
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ SaleType,
               data = training.data,
               mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

Let us explore a few opportunities to combine the levels.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ SaleType,
            data = training.data,
            subset = SaleType %in% c("ConLI", "CWD"))
```

They can be grouped together.

```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ SaleType,
            data = training.data,
            subset = SaleType %in% c("ConLD", "ConLW", "COD"))
```

These too can be clubbed together.
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ SaleType,
            data = training.data,
            subset = SaleType %in% c("Con", "New"))
```

We can group them together as well.

Let us map the levels to new ones.
```{r}
saletype.map <-
  data.frame(SaleType = X[order(X$avg.price), "SaleType"],
             st.class = as.factor(c(1, rep(2, 3), 3, rep(4, 2), rep(5, 2))))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, saletype.map)[, c("st.class", "SalePrice")]
bwplot(SalePrice ~ st.class, X)
aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ st.class, X, mean)
rm(X, saletype.map)
```

We now look at sale condition. From preliminary analysis we know that the 
sale type WD is distributed across sale conditions. Therefore, we cannot 
treat the two as correlated with each other. Let us check if we can collapse
the levels of SaleCondition.
```{r}
X <- aggregate(cbind(avg.price = SalePrice) ~ SaleCondition, 
               training.data, mean)
X[order(X$avg.price), ]
```

Are 'Abnorml' and 'Family' similar?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ SaleCondition,
            data = training.data,
            subset = SaleCondition %in% c("Abnorml", "Family"))
```

They can be grouped together.

Are 'Alloca' and 'Normal' similar?
```{r}
oneway.test(SalePrice ~ SaleCondition,
            data = training.data,
            subset = SaleCondition %in% c("Alloca", "Normal"))
```

They too can be clubbed together.

Let us check the new levels.
```{r}
sc.map <-
  data.frame(SaleCondition = X[order(X$avg.price), "SaleCondition"],
             sc.class = as.factor(c(1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4)))
rm(X)
X <- merge(training.data, sc.map)[, c("sc.class", "SalePrice")]
bwplot(SalePrice ~ sc.class, X)
rm(sc.map, X)
```

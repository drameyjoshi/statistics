# Returning to the model summary, we note the following:
# 1. The R-squared and the adjusted R-squared are very low. Recall that R-squared
#    is the ratio of ESS to SS.
SS <- sum((Y$BLI - mean(Y$BLI))^2)
ESS <- sum((fitted(m1) - mean(Y$BLI))^2)
R.squared <- ESS/SS
# Only 4% of the total variation in the data is explained by the model. Another
# view point is that R.squared is the square of correlation between actual and
# predicted values. (That's also the reason it is called r^2.)

# Recall that adjusted R^2 is calculated as
adj.R.sq <- 1 - (1 - R.squared) * (nrow(Y) - 1)/(nrow(Y) - 1 - 1)

\begin{enumerate}
\item The linear model is $y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$,
where $\epsilon_i$ are i.i.d. $\mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ and $1 \le i \le n$.
\begin{enumerate}
\item As $\hat{y}_i = \bar{y} + b_1(x_i - \bar{x})$, summing over all $i$,
we get
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^n\hat{y}_i = n\bar{y} + b_1\left(\sum_{i=1}^nx_i - \bar{x}\right)
\]
However,
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^n x_i = n\bar{x}
\]
so that the last term in the first equation vanishes and we get
\begin{equation}\label{e1}
    \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n\hat{y}_i = \bar{y}.
\end{equation}
\item Since $e_i = y_i - \hat{y}_i$,
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^ne_i = \sum_{i=1}^ny_i - \sum_{i=1}^n\hat{y}_i.
\]
From equation \eqref{e1},
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^ne_i = \sum_{i=1}^ny_i - n\bar{y}.
\]
However, by definition of sample mean, $\sum_{i=1}^n y_i = n\bar{y}$,
so that
\begin{equation}\label{e2}
\sum_{i=1}^n e_i = 0.
\end{equation}
\item I cannot prove this yet.
\item We know from the theory of regression that
\begin{equation}\label{e3}
b_1 = \frac{\sum_{j=1}^N(x_j - \bar{x})(y_j - \bar{y})}{\sum_{j=1}^N(x_j - \bar{x})^2}
\end{equation}
We also know that $\hat{y}_i - \bar{y} = b_1(x_i - \bar{x})$. Using these facts, we 
readily get
\[
\sum_{i=1}^n(\hat{y}_i - \bar{y})^2 = b_1^2\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2.
\]
Using equation \eqref{e3} and remembering that the indices $i$ and $j$ are just dummies
so that
\[
\sum_{i=1}^N(x_i - \bar{x})^2 = \sum_{j=1}^N(x_j - \bar{x})^2.
\]
The result now follows immediately.
\item We can write equation \eqref{e1} as
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^n \hat{y}_i = n\bar{y} = \sum_{i=1}^n\bar{y}
\]
so that
\[
    \sum_{i=1}^n(\bar{y}_i - \bar{y}) = 0.
\]
\item Follows immediately from (c) and the definition of $SS_{\text{total}}$ as
\[
    SS_{\text{total}} = \sum_{i=1}^N(y_i - \bar{y})^2.
\]
The expression in terms of sample variances and covariance also follows immediately
from the definition of the terms.

\item I can only partially answer this question.
\begin{enumerate}
\item $r_{xy} = \sqrt{0.7114} = 0.8434453$.
\item Can't solve.
\item Can't solve.
\item Can't solve.
\item $p$ value is $1.196368e-07$.
I know the formulae for $t$-statistics, its $p$-value and the standard error of the slope.
However, I can't see how one can get their values from what we have.
\end{enumerate}
\item The '?' in ANOVA table are derived here:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Regression df is $1$, residual df are $20$.
\item Regression $MS$ is $1.13 \times 430.65 = 486.6345$.
\item Regression $SS$ is regression df times regression MS, which is $486.6345$.
\item Residual $SS$ is residual df times residual MS, which is $20 \times 1.13 = 22.6$.
\item Total $SS$ is the sum of regression and residual $SS$m which is $509.2345$.
\item $p$-value is $2.220446e-16$.
\end{enumerate}

\item All quantities can be found using the following R program.
\begin{verbatim}
x.bar <- 39.12
y.bar <- 310.72
var.x <- 150.03
var.y <- 605.738
s.xy <- 798.24

# These two should give you the regression equation.
b1 <- s.xy/var.x
b0 <- y.bar - b1*x.bar
cat(paste("y =", b0, " + ", b1, "x\n"))

N <- 25 # Number of observations
regression.df <- 1 # This is a univariate regression
residual.df <- (N - 1) - regression.df

# Regression sum of square
reg.ss <- b1^2 * var.x
# Total sum of square can be immediately found from sample variance.
tot.ss <- (N - 1) * var.y
# Residual sum of square
res.ss <- tot.ss - reg.ss

# Regression variance
reg.var <- reg.ss/1
# Residual variance
res.var <- res.ss/(N - 2)

# F statistics
F.stat <- reg.var/res.var

# p-value
p = 1 - pf(F.stat, regression.df, residual.df)

print(paste("Regression df =", regression.df))
print(paste("Residual df =", residual.df))
print(paste("Regression SS =", reg.ss))
print(paste("Residual SS =", res.ss))
print(paste("Total SS =", tot.ss))
print(paste("Regression MS =", reg.var))
print(paste("Residual MS =", res.var))
print(paste("F statistics =", F.stat))
print(paste("p-value =", p))
\end{verbatim}
Its output is

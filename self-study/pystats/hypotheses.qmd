# Hypothesis Testing in Practice

The fundamental idea underlying hypothesis testing is checking if we have 
enough statistical evidence to reject a null hypothesis. However, in practice
one needs many other metrics other than a verdict of the test. In this chapter,
we will consider some of them.

## Confidence intervals {#sec-c3s1}
While testing hypotheses we often compute a 'test statistic', usually denoted by
$T$, and find out the probability of getting a value as extreme or more than
what we got, under the null hypothesis. If the probability of so happening is
extremely low we conclude that an event like this can happen only rarely under
the null hypothesis and therefore reject it hypothesis. The choice of the 
threshold for calling a probability 'low' is a matter of personal choice. In 
order to minimise the impact of the researcher's bias, one needs more 
information about the situation than the two probabilities. 

Consider the situation when we are testing whether a sample of a large size $n$
is drawn from a population of mean $\mu$ and suppose that we know the population
variance $\sigma^2$. If the null hypothesis is that the sample is drawn from
the population then the appropriate test statistic is
$$
T = \frac{\bar{X}_n - \mu}{\sigma}\sqrt{n}.
$$ {#eq-c3e1}
Under the null hypothesis, the statistic $T$ follows a standard normal 
distribution. This is our 'null distribution'. If $\alpha$ is the maximum 
probability of committing a type I error then we decide the hypothesis after 
comparing the probability of getting a value of $T$ as extreme or more than we 
got in @{eq-c3e1} with $\alpha$. 

$\bar{X}_n$ can differ from $\mu$ either because $\bar{X}_n < \mu$ or $\bar{X}_n
> \mu$. Since the null distribution is symmetric, both events happen with equal
probability. If $\alpha$ is our threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis then
we distribute it evenly among the two possibilities. That is, we reject the
null hypothesis if:

- $F_T(T) \le \alpha/2$ or
- $F_T(T) \ge 1 - \alpha/2$.

The first of these events covers the possibiity of $\bar{X}_n$ being much lower
than $\mu$ and the second one cover the possibility of $\bar{X}_n$ being much
larger than $\mu$. The function $F_T$ is the null distribution function, here
a standard normal.

The two possibilities above can be expressed in an equivalent manner as:

- $T \le F_T^{-1}(\alpha/2)$ or
- $T \ge F_T^{-1}(1 - \alpha/2)$.

In this case, the statistic $T$ follows the standard normal distribution. 
Therefore $F_T = \Phi$.
